# Predicting Student Dropout Rates in Higher Education

Project Question: Can we develop a predictive model using demographic, social-economic, and academic performance factors to identify students at risk of dropping out of higher education institutions?

### About this Project:

This project aims to analyze dropout and graduation rates of students in higher education institutions and develop a predictive model to identify potential risk factors. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing demographic, socioeconomic, and academic performance information of students.

### Subsidirary Questions:

1. What factors have the biggest impact on student's academic success? 
2. Which degree/track has the highest drop out rate?

The main dataset used for this project provides a comprehensive view of students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees offered at a higher education institution. It includes information such as marital status, application mode, course chosen, attendance, previous qualifications, parental qualifications and occupations, special needs, and more. Additionally, it includes data on curricular units, grades, and economic factors like unemployment rate, inflation rate, and GDP from the region.

## Resources

In addition to the main dataset, additional resources used for this project include:

The project incorporates an additional data set that focuses on student achievement in secondary education from two Portuguese schools. The data set includes student grades and various demographic, social, and school-related features. The data was collected through school reports and questionnaires. The data set provides information on two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language.

The inclusion of this secondary data set presents an opportunity to expand the analysis and predictions beyond higher education and explore the factors that influence student performance in secondary education. By examining the relationship between student grades and various attributes, such as demographic and social factors, the project can gain insights into the determinants of academic success at the secondary level.

Incorporating this secondary data set enhances the project's scope by including a different educational level and exploring factors that contribute to student achievement. The findings from this analysis can provide valuable insights into the factors affecting student success across different stages of education, informing interventions and strategies to support students' academic journey.
